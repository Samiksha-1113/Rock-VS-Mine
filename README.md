# Rock-VS-Mine
This project applies machine learning techniques to differentiate between sonar signals bounced off rocks and mines. Using a labeled dataset, the model learns to classify signals as coming from either a metallic mine or a rock, which is a common problem in underwater object classification.

Technologies Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy

Approach: Data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training (e.g., Logistic Regression)

Key Features-
Interactive notebook for training and evaluating classification models.
Step-by-step data analysis and visualization.
Reproducible workflow on Google Colab.

Usage-
Clone the repository and open the notebook in Google Colab to run the analysis and train your model on the sonar dataset.

Feel free to personalize this according to your workflow and model choices!
